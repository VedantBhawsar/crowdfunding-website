Implementation Strategy

Start with core contracts: Focus on building and testing the foundational smart contracts first
Build essential UI components: Create the campaign listing, details, and funding components
Connect wallet integration: Ensure wallet connection works flawlessly
Complete user flows: Implement the campaign creation and funding flows
Add advanced features: Implement milestones, rewards, and governance
Polish and refine: Focus on UI/UX improvements and performance optimizations
Test thoroughly: Ensure all features work correctly across different scenarios
Deploy to testnet: Get real-world testing and feedback
Final audit and launch: Perform security audit and deploy to mainnet

This plan should give you a clear roadmap to complete your decentralized crowdfunding platform while building on your existing implementation.
